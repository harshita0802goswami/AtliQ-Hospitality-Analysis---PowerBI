# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis-PowerBI
As part of Codebasics resume challenge, I have built a dashboard in Power BI to analyze three months sales data of different AtliQ hotels across four different cities.

## üèÜ Challenge Overview  
This project was part of the **CodeBasics Resume Challenge**, where I worked on analyzing **AtliQ Grands' revenue performance** using **Power BI**.

## üìå Problem Statement  
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India, has been **losing market share and revenue** due to ineffective decision-making and rising competition. To regain its position, the management decided to incorporate **Business & Data Intelligence** but lacked an in-house data analytics team.  

The **Revenue Management Team** outsourced the analysis to derive **actionable insights** from historical data, aiming to optimize revenue strategies.  

## üìã Task List  
As a **Data Analyst**, I worked on the following:  
‚úÖ Created **key business metrics** based on the provided metric list.  
‚úÖ Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** aligned with stakeholder expectations.  
‚úÖ Generated **additional insights** beyond the given mock-up and metrics.
