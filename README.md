## 📌 Problem Statement  
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India, has been **losing market share and revenue** due to ineffective decision-making and rising competition. To regain its position, the management decided to incorporate **Business & Data Intelligence** but lacked an in-house data analytics team.  

The **Revenue Management Team** outsourced the analysis to derive **actionable insights** from historical data, aiming to optimize revenue strategies.  

## 📋 Task List  
As a **Data Analyst**, I worked on the following:  
✅ Created **key business metrics** based on the provided metric list.  
✅ Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** aligned with stakeholder expectations.  
✅ Generated **additional insights** beyond the given mock-up and metrics.
